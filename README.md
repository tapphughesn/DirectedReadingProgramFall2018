# DirectedReadingProgramFall2018
A repository to store the work I did while I was a student in the Math Directed Reading Program at UNC Chapel Hill during Fall 2018.

The .pdf file contains a beamer presentation that I created with LaTeX. 
The .jar file is a java program which allows users to build a d-complete poset
(implemented as a directed graph using strings for node labels). If the poset 
is d-complete (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_partial_order), then the program can evaluate 
the number of linear extensions of the poset.

In order to run the file you will need Java SE Development Kit 8. You can run it 
from the command line (Terminal), or by importing it into a Java IDE.
