# DirectedReadingProgramFall2018
A repository to store the work I did while I was a student in the Math Directed Reading Program at UNC Chapel Hill during Fall 2018.

The .pdf file contains a beamer presentation that I created with LaTeX. 
The .jar file is a java program which allows users to build a directed-complete poset
(implemented as a directed graph using strings for node labels). If the poset 
is d-complete (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_partial_order), then the program can evaluate 
the number of linear extensions of the poset.

In order to run the file you will need Java SE Development Kit 8.
