# DirectedReadingProgramFall2018
A repository to store the work I did while I was a student in the Math Directed Reading Program at UNC Chapel Hill during Fall 2018.

The .pdf file contains a beamer presentation that I created with LaTeX. 
The .jar file is a java program which allows users to build a d-complete poset
(implemented as a directed graph using strings for node labels). If the poset 
is d-complete (see http://proctor.math.unc.edu/), then the program can evaluate 
the number of linear extensions of the poset.
